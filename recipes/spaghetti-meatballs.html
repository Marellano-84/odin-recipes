    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook the spaghetti in a large pot with boiling salted water, following
        the package instructions until al dente.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, mix the ground meat, breadcrumbs, milk, egg, Parmesan
        cheese, parsley, garlic, salt, and pepper. Knead well and form
        medium-sized meatballs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the
        meatballs and cook, turning them occasionally, until they are golden
        brown on all sides. Remove the meatballs from the pan and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same skillet, add the chopped onion and cook over medium heat
        until tender and translucent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the crushed tomatoes, sugar, bay leaf, and dried oregano. Cook over
        medium-low heat for 20-25 minutes, until the sauce has thickened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the meatballs to the skillet with the sauce, cover, and simmer
        for 10-15 minutes until the meatballs are fully cooked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the spaghetti and serve it on plates. Top with the meatball sauce
        and sprinkle with additional grated Parmesan cheese and fresh chopped
        parsley if desired.
