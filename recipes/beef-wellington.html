    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Beef Wellington</b> is a steak dish of English origin, made out of
      fillet steak coated with pâté (often pâté de foie gras) and duxelles,
      wrapped in puff pastry, then baked
    </p>
    <p>
      Some recipes include wrapping the coated meat in a crêpe or dry-cured ham
      to retain the moisture and prevent it from making the pastry soggy
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        (1 1/2 to 2 pounds) center-cut Certified Angus Beef ® tenderloin roast
      </li>
      <li>3 teaspoons coarse kosher salt, divided</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons fresh cracked pepper, divided</li>
      <li>8 ounces cremini (baby bella) mushrooms, halved</li>
      <li>4 ounces shiitake mushrooms, woody stems removed and halved</li>
      <li>3 ounces oyster mushrooms, cut into 2-inch chunks</li>
      <li>3 large shallots, halved</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons canola oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons brandy or white wine</li>
      <li>6 slices prosciutto, very thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>2 sheets puff pastry</li>
      <li>1 cup flour</li>
      <li>1 whole egg, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season tenderloin evenly with 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.
        Vacuum seal and sous vide roast at the desired degree of doneness for
        two hours (130°F for medium rare).
      </li>
      <li>
        While tenderloin cooks, prepare mushroom duxelles. Working in batches,
        pulse mushrooms in a food processor until they are coarsely chopped, but
        not pureed; transfer to a plate. Pulse shallots and garlic in processor
        until minced.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a large non-stick pan over medium
        heat. Add shallot-garlic blend and sauté for 2 minutes. Stir in
        mushrooms, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and continue to sear
        over medium heat until the mixture has released most of its moisture and
        becomes fairly dry, about 10 minutes. When pressed against the side of
        the pan, no juices should run from the mushroom mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in thyme leaves and deglaze with alcohol, continually stirring for
        2 minutes. Spoon duxelles onto a plate or sheet pan in a thin layer;
        refrigerate until cold (30 minutes to 1 hour).
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove tenderloin from bag and pat dry. Preheat a medium cast iron or
        stainless-steel skillet to high, add 1 tablespoon canola oil and sear
        tenderloin quickly on all sides. The goal here is to evenly brown the
        surface without cooking the inside. Make sure to sear both ends of the
        roast as well. This should only take a few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place tenderloin on a plate and refrigerate until cold, around 2 hours.
        Meanwhile, thaw puff pastry in refrigerator (if frozen).
      </li>
      <li>
        Lay out two 18-inch lengths of plastic wrap horizontally, slightly
        overlapping to create a sheet about 16-inches wide and 18-inches long.
        In the middle of the plastic, lay slices of prosciutto slightly
        overlapping them with the length of the prosciutto running from top to
        bottom. Ensure that the total prosciutto sheet created is the same width
        as the length of the tenderloin roast.
      </li>
      <li>
        Evenly spread a 1/4-inch layer of chilled mushroom duxelles on the
        entire prosciutto layer (there may be a small amount of duxelles left
        over depending on the size of the roast). Brush chilled tenderloin with
        Dijon mustard.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place tenderloin at the bottom edge of the duxelles topped prosciutto,
        roll towards the top using the plastic wrap to keep it adhered tightly
        to the roast. Once tenderloin has been wrapped, make sure no plastic has
        become tucked into the roll then tightly wrap in the plastic. Twist ends
        to ensure beef is tightly encased, it should feel like one cohesive
        piece; refrigerate 30 minutes to 1 hour until firm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dust a workspace with a handful of flour, roll out one sheet of puff
        pastry until it is large enough to wrap the roast, the plastic wrapped
        roast can be used to estimate the sizing. Overlap two more 18-inch
        lengths of plastic (as with prosciutto) to create a large plastic sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lay pastry in the middle of the plastic with the length running from top
        to bottom. Unwrap roast carefully, lay at the bottom edge of pastry.
        Wrap the roast in pastry, using the plastic to keep it tightly adhered
        to the roast. Brush top edge with about 1-inch of egg wash before
        completing the wrap. Once fully encased in pastry, tightly wrap the
        roast in the plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 10 minutes or up to 1
        day ahead.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 425°F. Dust work space with another handful of flour,
        slightly roll out remaining pastry sheet. Dust sheet after rolling and
        use lattice cutter to firmly cut marks in sheet by working from bottom
        to top of the sheet. Gently spread lattice apart, using a paring knife
        to separate any pieces not completely cut through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unwrap Wellington and place it on a sheet pan lined with silicone mat or
        parchment paper. Brush with egg wash and gently lay lattice over top of
        roast using a paring knife to adjust any lattice openings. Cut away
        excess lattice with bench scraper or paring knife and brush roast’s
        lattice with remaining egg wash.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake Wellington 25 minutes, rotate roast 180 degrees and bake 20 more
        minutes until crust is golden brown with an internal temperature is 90°
        F.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from oven and let rest 10 minutes or until it reaches the
        internal temperature of desired doneness (130° for medium rare). Roast
        will continue to cook while resting so make sure to monitor internal
        temp so that it doesn’t exceed desired doneness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice with serrated knife into 1 to 1 1/2-inch thick slices to serve.
      </li>
